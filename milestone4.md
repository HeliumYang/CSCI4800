## A. High-Fidelity Prototype:

<div>
          1. The Prototype
</div>

<div style="background: ghostwhite; 
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 10px;">
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FTFvIOLmLwQEdWH0Q2Su1XA%2FFinal-Prototype---Marianne-and-the-Bois%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          2a. User Story - Instant Messaging:
</div>

<div style="background: ghostwhite; 
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 10px;">
            <i>"As a concerned and confused student, I would like to message a classmate, within a short time frame, to ask about an assignment that is due in the near future."</i><br>
            <br>
            With the original instant messaging feature on eLC, we found that many students were unaware of how best to navigate around and would often miss notifications. When trying to quickly contact classmates through the chat, it is crucial for users to intuitively find their messages from any page in the site. To alleviate this pain point within the existing system, we expanded the messages button to display instant messages, and filter them apart from class and email notifications. By utilizing a sliding filter switch, we hoped to sort out the combined list of alerts so that the users could have distinct sections to find exactly what they are searching for. In the context of instant messaging, this could prevent the student form losing their chat messages in a sea of notifications, therefore reducing the time it takes to respond.

            <i>"As a student who would like a more personalized visual experience on eLc, I would like to customize my user and display settings so that I can more easily intepret and respond to messages sent through eLC."</i><br>

            <i>"As one of many students within a class, I would like to easily navigate to pinned and popular messages within a group chat, and respond to individual messages with reactions and replies."</i><br>
