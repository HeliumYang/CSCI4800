## A. Task & Problem Identification:

<div>
1. Introduce your problem.
</div>
            
<div style="background: ghostwhite; 
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 10px;">
            <b>Describe your problem using properties, affordances, and signifiers?</b><br>
            The problem that we currently have is that the eLC messaging and communication system is bulky and unintuitive for its users. the layout of some of eLC's properties, such as the messaging icon and layout, suggests that it has the messaging function that is similar to that of any other common messaging service, attached to the main appication. In reality, the eLC messaging system lacks affordances such as creating group chats, viewing context of messages, a proper notification system, and more.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Why is it a problem?</b><br>
            This is a problem, because a lot of the time, sending messages through eLC is extremely inconvenient, and many students go to third party applications to more easiy communicate with one another. However, there's problems with this approach, as it's very difficult to reach out and include every student in the course along with the possibility that some students just do not want to download a third partyapplication. School-oriented group chats and servers are also often prone to scam and spam bots.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How is it theme relevant?</b><br>
            eLC is a platform used by UGA students and professors alike, and having a well imagined messaging system on the platform rather than something that is confusing to use and leads the students off platform, can allow for the students to better connect with each other and the professor, as everything is integrated into the same platform that the students and professors are required to have in the first place. This ensures that students are not left out when creating class chats, along with the convenience of keeping everything in one place.

2. Identify your potential users.
</div>
            
<div style="background: ghostwhite; 
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 10px;">
            <b>What user population is affected by your problem of study?</b><br>
            Our potential users are students and instructors of UGA that are using eLC for communications.<br>

            <b>What related tasks do they perform?</b><br>
            [TASKS]<br>

            <b>How would users benefit from a solution (not necessarily your solution) to your problem of study?</b><br>

## B. Analysis of Existing Solutions:

<div>
1. Describe existing solutions.
</div>
            
<div style="background: ghostwhite; 
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 10px;">
            People utilize other third-party applications for a variety of reasons, each of these applications have their own strengths and weaknesses. 

GroupMe: This is a chatroom application that is often used to gather students in the same classes, extracurricular organizations, and/or groups together. 

When dissecting why this application was chosen, many students claimed that it’s the perfect place to host a “discourse community” – a community of members with shared interests, ideas, languages, and knowledge (Ly 114). But the biggest reason why this application is used in an educational context is because it is “perhaps the easiest and fastest way to send and receive messages” (Ly 131). This is most likely because it is easy to access through handheld phones, instead of eLC’s awkward desktop navigation to the messaging system. Students also perceive GroupMe to be a great place for varying levels of formality. Especially when the GroupMe is composed of just other classmates, the environment is typically more relaxed, casual, and easygoing. Even when students are put into GroupMe chats with instructors, their “formal” messages are still significantly more casual than messages sent through email. It is socially acceptable to respond as sooner or later as other users want. The application strengthens the users’ “ several forms of rhetorical thinking when they compose messages” depending on who is in the GroupMe (Ly 132). 

However, with the application being detached from first-party applications, students often had difficulty inviting people to the chat without another channel of communication. This risks GroupMe having echo chambers or not a diverse amount of people. Users also felt pressured to conform to a certain guideline of correct grammar, with the risk of being perceived negatively by other classmates. Students also had difficulty saving important information and repetitiveness was often seen in this application, hinting at the inability to highlight important information in this application.



Discord and Slack: These are multi-threaded communication applications meant for large communities of people.

Slack is an application that was developed for businesses, knowing that their audience was full of people with less technological literacy. However, it is arguable that Slack is incredibly similar to Discord with many identical features and look alike layout. The difference between Discord and Slack is the accessibility and lack of a few key features. There are plenty of icon signifiers in Slack’s layout and Slack also includes pop-up windows if the user hovers over areas that tell what the function does. The shortcuts for actions are also explicitly said, implying that the developers knew that a “small proportion of users rely on keyboard shortcuts” (ARTICLE CITE). There is no quick way to do voice calls, and screen-sharing / calling is not found easily within the Slack system at all. 

Discord was developed for the TeamSpeak for the gaming community. For this reason, the Discord application has the most varied range of features, all catering to specific areas of gaming. It is considered to be visually attractive and handy for running large organizations. In the context of education, Discord eliminates a lot of need for other applications (Zoom, GroupMe, etc) because of how much it has. Screensharing, video calls, and voice calls are all created for gamers who will most likely be playing a game while using Discord. For this reason, Discord was made with consideration to the computer’s performance, taking up less internet demand and having less lag overall. With its market audience always on the computer, there is an incredibly robust amount of personalization on every aspect of the application to make it feel familiar for each user. However, Discord’s “gamification” – the “feel” being catered for gaming and entertainment – makes the application feel inappropriate for some classrooms. People who also were never introduced into the gaming community found the application intimidating, confusing, and extremely complicated (186).

eLC and Outlook Emails:
eLC and Outlook are used in conjunction with each other specifically within the UGA system. eLC, or Brightspace, is a good place for students to view asynchronous information posted by instructors for their classes. Locating the correct students for each class is incredibly easy because there is an in-house class list that is available from the Messaging tab. Everything is also organized neatly by class, so it is difficult to accidentally send an announcement to the wrong class.

Outlook and eLC email notifications are deeply flawed. Outlook creates a second eLC email for everybody enrolled in the class, which is then unable to be replied to without an error message coming up. With asynchronous information, it is also customary to send bulk emails or mass messages instead of directly messaging people through IM software. Instructors will often utilize this function. However, bulk emails are often discarded, ignored, and barely read in detail (ARVIX 9). People lose trust in these announcements after instructors try to send more information to fight the students’ confusion and frustration. Thus, there becomes a cycle where emails keep being unread (ARVIX CITE). On top of this, eLC does not allow for group messaging, despite having multiple recipients.
