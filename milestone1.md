UGA forms of communication, such as eLC and Outlook are not very efficient and are very bulky/not accessible, making it hard to group communication, so students have to resort to external chats like GroupMe, which has their own flaws. Students want a form of informal communication This is obvious because we are using third party apps to fill this need. Students want and should be able to network with the other students in their classes and work out issues in these classes. Some issues arise from using these third party apps such as the group messages not including everyone in the class and not being able to group messages by topic.

eLC seems to have a communication system with "Email" and "Instant Message" through the classlist. However, the designs of both systems are very flawed in their own way. The email system is self contained in a way where you have to operate within the eLC app. You do get an email notification most of the time, but you cannot use your regular email to reply to an eLC email, which makes it prone for messages to get lost by user error. The instant messaging system is first of all, not very accessible. The notifications for the messages are grouped amongst other eLC notifications, rather than having its own tab, making it very hard to keep track of past messages. Although it's possible to send instant messages to multiple recipients, they're not grouped after the messages are sent, making it very difficult to track group communication.

In other types of group messaging that most students are exposed to, it's assumed that when you send a mass instant message, a group chat would be created where all recipients would be able to respond to the same thread. This is not the case with eLC, which makes it confusing to students using this function for the first time. Another factor of limitation is how hidden these functions are. It's buried deep in the classlist tab, instead of having something like a dedicated tab. When it comes to sending eLC emails, it's very confusing to have it be so similar to a student's UGA email address, yet they're not in anyway linked to the student's email, making it confusing to know how to reply to email messages from eLC.

The email and instant messaging system is inconvenient, not only to the students on campus, but to some professors as well. There are many professors who go so far as to having to specify to their students to not use eLC's emailing and messaging systems to contact them in order to avoid lost messages.
